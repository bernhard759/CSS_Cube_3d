### CSS and JS Cube 3D
This is a 3D Cube made with CSS and animated with CSS and some JavaScript. The Box containing the cube has a resize observer attachted to it and changes the cubes `translateZ`.
You can start an animation that rotates the cube in X and Y-direction. You can also enable Mousemove, which lets you move the cube by moving the computer mouse over the cube div.

The project is deployed to gh-pages (https://bernhard759.github.io/CSS_Cube_3d/).
